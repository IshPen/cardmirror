# CardMirror relay (self-hosting)

The server behind CardMirror's collaboration features — both **card
sharing** (store-and-forward mailbox) and **co-editing** (real-time
session rooms). Everything is **end-to-end encrypted by the app** —
this server only ever sees opaque ciphertext, a hashed routing code,
and timestamps. Mailbox messages are forgotten after 3 hours whether
or not they were delivered; co-editing rooms hold their (encrypted)
session log until the host ends the session or the room has been idle
for 7 days. New cards and session updates are live-pushed to connected
apps over SSE; the app also catches up by polling on every reconnect,
so nothing is lost while a machine is offline.

Run your own if you'd rather not use the official relay. Everyone
sharing cards with each other must point at the same relay.

## Quick start (docker compose)

```sh
cd relay
RELAY_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24) docker compose up -d
```

Then in CardMirror on every machine: **Settings → Collaboration** →
**Custom relay URL** = `http://<your-host>:8410/relay`, **Custom relay
token** = the same token. Use HTTPS (a reverse proxy such as Caddy or
your platform's TLS) for anything beyond a LAN.

## Running it elsewhere

Any host that runs a Python process + Postgres works (Railway, Fly,
a VPS…). Requirements:

- env `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres) and `RELAY_TOKEN` (any long random
  string — it's the shared bearer, not the privacy mechanism).
- **Exactly one worker process** (`uvicorn server:app`, no
  `--workers`): the live-push registry is in-process.
- Recommended: `--limit-concurrency 4096` (the Dockerfile sets this) as
  a connection-storm backstop. It counts long-lived SSE streams too, so
  keep it far above the number of apps you expect connected at once.
- Required: `--timeout-graceful-shutdown 5` (the Dockerfile sets this).
  Without it a stopped instance waits forever for its open SSE streams
  and lingers as an unbound zombie that keeps heartbeating old clients
  while the new instance owns the port — their live pushes then go
  nowhere until the clients notice on their own.
- The tables are created automatically on first start.

Health check: `GET /relay/health` → `{"ok": true}` (no auth).

## Per-student tokens (optional, attribution)

By default one shared `RELAY_TOKEN` authenticates everyone. To attribute
room creation and live participation to individuals, set **`RELAY_TOKENS`**
instead — a JSON object mapping each person's token to an identity:

```jsonc
RELAY_TOKENS={
  "s3cret-maya-…":  {"label": "Maya",     "role": "student"},
  "s3cret-coach-…": {"label": "Coach Lee", "role": "coach"}
}
```

- No client change: each person just pastes their own token into
  **Settings → Collaboration → Custom relay token** (same field as before).
- `role` is `student` or `coach`. Ending a session
  (`DELETE /relay/rooms/{id}`) requires `coach` **only when `RELAY_TOKENS`
  is set**; with a single `RELAY_TOKEN` it stays open, exactly as before.
- Attribution is stored as operator-assigned labels only — the relay still
  reads no plaintext. `relay_rooms.created_by` records the creator, and
  `relay_room_participants` mirrors who is currently connected (labels, not
  tokens) so a dashboard can display it.
- Revoke a student by removing their token from `RELAY_TOKENS` and
  restarting. Leave `RELAY_TOKENS` unset to keep the original behavior.

**DB-backed tokens (v2.1, no redeploy).** The relay also reads a
`relay_tokens` table (created automatically). When that table has any
rows it becomes the source of truth and `RELAY_TOKENS` is ignored; when
empty, it falls back to the env var. A background thread refreshes the
cache every ~30s, so a dashboard that manages `relay_tokens` (as an
authenticated Supabase coach — see `dashboard/relay-tokens.sql`) can add
or revoke people **instantly, with no env edit and no redeploy**. Nothing
changes for deployments that never populate the table.

## Notes

- One `RELAY_TOKEN` covers both features — card sharing and co-editing
  sessions authenticate with the same shared bearer. (With `RELAY_TOKENS`
  set, any token in the map authenticates both features.)
- Co-editing rooms: at most **10 people** per session (enforced at
  stream connect), 5 MB per update (the app chunks bigger ones),
  200 MB stored per room.
- Payload cap 25 MB decompressed / 30 MB gzipped per send.
- Poll returns at most 100 messages, oldest first; the app deletes
  each message after it lands.
- CardMirror also works against a relay without the `/stream`
  endpoint by falling back to interval polling — but this server
  includes push, so you get instant delivery.
- Plugin allowlist: clients pointed at this relay ask it which GitHub
  repos the in-app plugin installer may install from
  (`GET /relay/plugin-allowlist`, no auth — public data). Configure
  the list with `RELAY_PLUGIN_ALLOWLIST` (comma-separated
  `owner/repo`); it defaults to the app's built-in list, so leaving it
  alone changes nothing. Plugins run with full access to CardMirror
  and your users' documents — curate deliberately. Individual users
  who want arbitrary repos can instead run
  `__plugins('community-on')` in the app's console.
